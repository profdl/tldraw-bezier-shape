## Pre-Handoff Tasks (Do First)

### Critical (Must Complete Before Handoff)

- [ ] **Review architectural questions with tldraw team**
  - Files: [TLDRAW_HANDOFF.md](TLDRAW_HANDOFF.md)
  - Questions: Edit mode storage, transform controls, double-click detection
  - **Blocking:** Other improvements depend on these decisions
  - **Time:** 1 day + waiting for tldraw team feedback

### High Priority (Strongly Recommended)

- [ ] **Add JSDoc documentation to public APIs**
  - Files: `BezierShapeUtil.tsx`, `BezierState.ts`, `BezierMath.ts`
  - What: Document all public methods with examples
  - **Impact:** Other developers can't easily use the code without this
  - **Time:** 1-2 days

- [ ] **Add error handling and validation**
  - Files: All interaction handlers
  - What: Null checks, array bounds, type guards
  - **Impact:** Prevents crashes from edge cases
  - **Time:** 1-2 days

- [ ] **Improve type safety**
  - Files: `bezierShape.ts`, all handlers
  - What: Type meta properties, safe array access, remove unsafe casts
  - **Impact:** Catches bugs at compile time
  - **Time:** 0.5-1 day

**Total Pre-Handoff Time:** ~4-6 days (+ tldraw team review time)

---

## Post-Handoff Tasks (Can Be Done Later)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Decompose large files**
  - `BezierShapeUtil.tsx` (659 lines) → 3-4 files
  - `Creating.ts` (902 lines) → 3-4 files
  - **Time:** 2-3 days

- [ ] **Consolidate duplicate code**
  - Point selection logic (3 places)
  - Segment drag logic (2 places)
  - Double-click detection (2 implementations)
  - **Time:** 1-2 days

- [ ] **Standardize code style**
  - Naming conventions
  - Import ordering
  - Optional chaining usage
  - **Time:** 0.5-1 day

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

- [ ] **Add comprehensive testing**
  - Unit tests for math utilities
  - Integration tests for tool states
  - E2E tests for workflows
  - **Time:** 1-2 weeks

- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - Profile handle cache
  - Optimize memoization keys
  - Test with 500+ point paths
  - **Time:** 1-2 days

- [ ] **Enhanced debug tooling**
  - Visual debug overlay
  - Performance monitoring
  - Shape validation tool
  - **Time:** 1-2 days

- [ ] **Documentation improvements**
  - ARCHITECTURE.md
  - KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md
  - API.md
  - **Time:** 1-2 days

## Files Requiring Attention

### Critical Review Needed

1. **[bezierShape.ts](src/lib/shapes/bezier/shared/bezierShape.ts)** (lines 26-75)
   - Issue: Edit mode stored in shape props
   - Decision needed: Keep in props vs. move to tool state?

2. **[Creating.ts](src/lib/shapes/bezier/toolStates/Creating.ts)** (lines 695, 858)
   - Issue: setTimeout workaround for transform controls
   - Decision needed: Use editor.batch() or lifecycle hook?

3. **[BezierShapeUtil.tsx](src/lib/shapes/bezier/BezierShapeUtil.tsx)** (lines 42-71)
   - Issue: Manual double-click tracking
   - Decision needed: Use tldraw pattern or keep custom?

### High Priority Improvements

4. **[BezierShapeUtil.tsx](src/lib/shapes/bezier/BezierShapeUtil.tsx)** (659 lines)
   - Add JSDoc to all public methods
   - Split into smaller files
   - Add error handling

5. **[BezierState.ts](src/lib/shapes/bezier/shared/bezierState.ts)** (647 lines)
   - Add more usage examples
   - Document state transitions
   - Add type guards

6. **[BezierEditModeHandler.tsx](src/lib/shapes/bezier/components/BezierEditModeHandler.tsx)** (442 lines)
   - Add error handling
   - Consolidate duplicate logic
   - Extract shared utilities

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Tagged with `TODO: [tldraw-handoff]`

Search codebase for these comments to find workarounds that need review:

```bash
grep -r "TODO: \[tldraw-handoff\]" src/lib/shapes/bezier
```

**Found in:**
- `bezierShape.ts:26` - Edit mode storage pattern
- `Creating.ts:695` - Transform control refresh on curve closing
- `Creating.ts:858` - Transform control init on curve completion
- `BezierShapeUtil.tsx:42` - Double-click detection approach

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Suggested Test Coverage

1. **Unit Tests** (High Value)
   - `BezierMath` utilities (pure functions)
   - `BezierState` operations (state transitions)
   - `BezierBounds` calculations (coordinate transforms)
   - **Target:** >80% coverage

2. **Integration Tests** (Medium Value)
   - Tool state machines (Idle → Creating → Editing)
   - Transform operations (resize, rotate, flip)
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - **Target:** Critical paths covered

3. **E2E Tests** (Low Value, High Confidence)
   - Complete pen tool workflow
   - Edit mode interactions
   - Complex shape operations
   - **Target:** Happy path + common edge cases

3. **Run in debug mode:**
   ```typescript
   // In bezierConstants.ts, set:
   export const BEZIER_DEBUG = true
   ```
   Then watch console for categorized logging during interactions

4. **Key patterns to understand:**
   - How tldraw's StateNode system works
   - How handles are generated and managed
   - How bounds are calculated and normalized
   - How edit mode is triggered and maintained

   - Walk through key files and their responsibilities
   - Explain design decisions and tradeoffs

3. **Outstanding Issues** (15 min)
   - Review known workarounds (setTimeout, double-click)
   - Discuss testing strategy
   - Prioritize improvements

4. **Next Steps** (15 min)
   - Assign action items from Priority 1

## Contact & Support

For questions about the bezier implementation:

1. **Code Questions:** Review inline comments and JSDoc
2. **Architectural Questions:** See [TLDRAW_HANDOFF.md](TLDRAW_HANDOFF.md)
3. **Improvement Suggestions:** See [RECOMMENDED_IMPROVEMENTS.md](RECOMMENDED_IMPROVEMENTS.md)
4. **Debug Issues:** Enable `BEZIER_DEBUG = true` in `bezierConstants.ts`

## Final Notes

### What's Working Well

- ✅ Clean service-oriented architecture (State, Math, Bounds)
- ✅ Comprehensive feature set (matches Illustrator/Figma)
- ✅ Good use of TypeScript types
- ✅ Thoughtful configuration system
- ✅ Solid mathematical foundation (bezier-js library)
- ✅ Follows tldraw patterns in many areas

### What Needs Attention

- ⚠️ Architectural questions need validation
- ⚠️ Public API documentation incomplete
- ⚠️ Error handling could be more robust
- ⚠️ Some large files could be decomposed
- ⚠️ No test coverage yet

### Overall Assessment

**Grade: A- (would be A+ with Priority 1 items addressed)**

This is a well-engineered implementation that demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail. The main gaps are documentation and defensive coding practices that become more important when handing off to other developers.

With 4-6 days of focused work on Priority 1 items (plus tldraw team review time), this code will be in excellent shape for production use and maintenance by other developers.
