# âœ… Draw Style Implementation Complete

## Summary

The "draw" dash style now creates tldraw's signature hand-drawn, sketchy appearance for bezier curves using the perfect-freehand library!

## What Was Added

### 1. perfect-freehand Package
Installed the same library tldraw uses internally for hand-drawn effects.

```bash
npm install perfect-freehand
```

### 2. Path Sampling Utility
Created [bezierPathSampling.ts](src/components/shapes/utils/bezierPathSampling.ts) to convert SVG bezier paths into discrete point arrays:

```typescript
export function sampleBezierPath(pathData: string, strokeWidth: number): Array<{ x: number; y: number }>
```

**Features:**
- Uses native SVG `path.getTotalLength()` and `path.getPointAtLength()`
- Adaptive sampling based on stroke width
- Smoother curves for thinner strokes
- Maintains curve fidelity

### 3. Enhanced BezierPath Component
Updated [BezierPath.tsx](src/components/shapes/components/BezierPath.tsx) with draw style rendering:

**When `dash === 'draw'`:**
1. Sample points along the bezier curve
2. Pass points through `getStroke()` from perfect-freehand
3. Convert stroke outline to SVG path using tldraw's `getSvgPathFromPoints()`
4. Render as filled path (not stroked)

**Draw Style Parameters:**
```typescript
{
  size: strokeWidth,        // Based on size style (s/m/l/xl)
  thinning: 0.6,           // Pressure simulation
  smoothing: 0.5,          // Curve smoothing
  streamline: 0.5,         // Input smoothing
  easing: (t) => Math.sin((t * Math.PI) / 2),  // Ease out sine
  simulatePressure: true,  // Vary thickness
  last: !isClosed,         // End cap behavior
}
```

## How It Works

### Regular Styles (solid, dashed, dotted)
```
Bezier Points â†’ SVG Path â†’ Stroke Path
```

### Draw Style
```
Bezier Points â†’ Sample Points â†’ perfect-freehand â†’ Outline Points â†’ Fill Path
```

The key difference: draw style fills a variable-width outline rather than stroking a thin path.

## Testing

âœ… Build succeeded
âœ… TypeScript validated
âœ… Dev server hot-reloading

### Try It Out

1. Open http://localhost:5174/
2. Press **`B`** to activate bezier tool
3. Draw a curve
4. Open the style panel
5. Change **Dash** to **"draw"**
6. You should see the sketchy, hand-drawn effect! âœ¨

### Test Different Sizes

- **Small (s)** - Thin sketchy line
- **Medium (m)** - Default sketchy thickness
- **Large (l)** - Thick sketchy stroke
- **XL (xl)** - Extra thick hand-drawn look

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Draw = Solid)
- Clean, perfect bezier curve
- Uniform stroke width
- Computer-generated look

### After (True Draw Style)
- Organic, hand-drawn appearance
- Variable thickness along path
- Pressure-sensitive effect
- Slightly wobbly, human feel

## Implementation Details

### Sampling Density

```typescript
const baseSampleDistance = Math.max(strokeWidth * 0.5, 1)
const numSamples = Math.ceil(totalLength / baseSampleDistance)
```

More samples = smoother curves but more computation.
The formula balances quality and performance.

### Perfect-Freehand Configuration

**Thinning (0.6):** How much thinner/thicker the stroke gets with pressure
**Smoothing (0.5):** How smooth the curves are (higher = smoother)
**Streamline (0.5):** How much to smooth input jitter
**Simulate Pressure:** Creates organic thickness variation

### Fill vs Stroke

Draw style renders as a **filled path** rather than a stroked line because:
- The outline created by perfect-freehand defines the edge
- Filling gives the variable-width hand-drawn effect
- Stroking would add an extra border

## Files Changed

1. **BezierPath.tsx** - Added draw style rendering logic
2. **bezierPathSampling.ts** (NEW) - Path sampling utilities
3. **package.json** - Added perfect-freehand dependency

## Performance Considerations

- Path sampling uses native SVG methods (fast)
- Sampling memoized with `useMemo`
- Only recomputes when path, size, or style changes
- No performance impact on non-draw styles

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Adjust thinning parameter based on user preference
- [ ] Add "scribble" effect for fills using multiple strokes
- [ ] Cache sampled points for frequently used paths
- [ ] Optimize sampling density further
- [ ] Add roughness variation parameter

## Comparison with tldraw Native Shapes

Your bezier draw style now matches tldraw's:
- âœ… Same perfect-freehand library
- âœ… Similar parameter configuration
- âœ… Consistent visual appearance
- âœ… Performance characteristics

## Conclusion

The draw style is now fully implemented! Your bezier shapes have that authentic, hand-drawn look that makes tldraw special.
