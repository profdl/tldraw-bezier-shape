# Bezier Pen Tool - Architectural Review Request

## Overview

I've implemented a near production-ready bezier pen tool for tldraw with Illustrator/Figma-style vector path creation and editing. The implementation is feature-complete and tested, but we have **3 architectural questions** that need your guidance before you continue and finalize the code.

**Repository:** tldraw-bezier-shape
**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Compiles with no TypeScript errors
**Lines of Code:** ~5,900 lines across 24 files

## ‚ùì Architectural Questions for tldraw Team

### Question 1: Edit Mode State Storage ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Location:** [`src/lib/shapes/bezier/shared/bezierShape.ts:26-90`](src/lib/shapes/bezier/shared/bezierShape.ts#L26-L90)

**Current Implementation:**

```typescript
export interface BezierShapeProps {
  // ... standard props (w, h, color, dash, size, fill)

  // UI interaction state stored in props:
  editMode?: boolean;
  selectedPointIndices?: number[];
  selectedSegmentIndex?: number;
}
```

**Why we did this:**

- Bezier shapes need an "edit mode" where users can select/move/add/delete points
- Storing in props makes state automatically persist through undo/redo
- Users expect point selection to survive undo operations (like text selection)

**Concerns:**

- Most tldraw shapes don't store UI state in props
- Edit state gets serialized with the shape (persisted, copy/pasted)
- Appears in undo/redo history (is this desirable?)
- Multiple shapes could theoretically be in edit mode simultaneously (though we prevent this)

**Alternatives we considered:**

1. **Separate editing tool**: Create a "bezier-editing" tool that manages selection state

   - Pros: Cleaner separation of data vs UI state
   - Cons: More complex tool state machine, loses undo/redo for point selection

2. **Editor instance state**: Store in `editor.getInstanceState().meta`

   - Pros: Not persisted with shape, follows tldraw patterns better
   - Cons: Lost on page refresh, doesn't survive undo/redo

3. **Hybrid approach**: editMode in props, selection in editor state
   - Pros: Best of both worlds potentially
   - Cons: Split brain - harder to reason about

**Question:** Which pattern do you recommend? Are there examples of other shapes with similar multi-point editing needs we should follow?

**Similar shapes in tldraw:**

- Line shape: Has multiple points but simpler editing model
- Draw shape: Has points but no individual point selection
- Arrow shape: Has start/end/mid points but fixed structure

### Question 2: Transform Controls Initialization ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Locations:**

- [`src/lib/shapes/bezier/toolStates/Creating.ts:706-709`](src/lib/shapes/bezier/toolStates/Creating.ts#L706-L709)
- [`src/lib/shapes/bezier/toolStates/Creating.ts:869-872`](src/lib/shapes/bezier/toolStates/Creating.ts#L869-L872)

**Current Implementation:**

```typescript
// After closing curve or completing path
setTimeout(() => {
  this.editor.setSelectedShapes([]);
  this.editor.setSelectedShapes([this.shapeId]);
}, 50); // or 10ms depending on context
```

**Why we did this:**

- When closing a bezier curve, the shape's geometry changes significantly
- Transform controls don't automatically update to match the new closed path bounds
- Toggling selection (deselect then reselect) forces controls to recalculate
- Different delays (10ms vs 50ms) for different operations based on testing

**Concerns:**

- Timing-dependent code is fragile and hard to test
- May break with future tldraw internal changes
- Causes brief visual flicker of selection handles
- Different timeout values suggest guesswork rather than proper integration

**What we need:**

- Proper way to signal that a shape's bounds have changed and transform controls need to refresh
- Is there a lifecycle hook after shape modification?
- Should we use `editor.batch()` for atomic operations?
- Different approach to shape creation that avoids this issue?

**Question:** What's the proper tldraw pattern for signaling that transform controls need to refresh after programmatic shape modifications?

**Reproduction:**
Without this code, closing a curve leaves transform handles positioned for the open path, not accounting for the closing segment's contribution to bounds.

### Question 3: Double-Click Detection üî∂ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Location:** [`src/lib/shapes/bezier/BezierShapeUtil.tsx:68-71`](src/lib/shapes/bezier/BezierShapeUtil.tsx#L68-L71)

**Current Implementation:**

```typescript
// ShapeUtil instance state for double-click tracking
private lastClickTime = 0
private lastClickedHandleId: string | null = null
private lastClickCount = 0
private readonly DOUBLE_CLICK_THRESHOLD = 300 // milliseconds
```

**Why we did this:**

- Need to detect double-clicks on anchor points to toggle smooth/corner type
- Also need to detect double-clicks on segments to add new points
- tldraw's `onDoubleClick` handler fires for the shape, but doesn't identify which anchor/segment
- Handle system doesn't provide double-click events on individual handles

**Concerns:**

- ShapeUtil instances may be recreated, causing click state loss
- Duplicates functionality that might exist in tldraw's event system
- Manual timing thresholds (300ms) may not match platform conventions
- Instance state may not be reliable

**Alternatives we considered:**

1. Store last click in `editor.getInstanceState().meta`
2. Move to tool state instead of ShapeUtil
3. Use a global WeakMap keyed by shape ID
4. Use only tldraw's native `onDoubleClick` (but loses granularity)

**Question:** Is there a native way to detect double-clicks on specific handles, or should we move this tracking to editor state/tool state instead of ShapeUtil instance state?

**Use cases:**

- Double-clicking an anchor point toggles it between smooth/corner
- Double-clicking a segment adds a new point at that location

## üí™ Implementation Strengths

### Solid Architecture

- **Service-oriented design**: Clean separation between `BezierState`, `BezierMath`, `BezierBounds`, and `BezierPathBuilder`
- **Pure functional APIs**: State services return new objects rather than mutating (perfect for React/tldraw)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused purpose

### Production-Quality Mathematics

- Leverages `bezier-js` library for accurate curve calculations
- Proper De Casteljau algorithm for curve splitting
- Accurate bounds calculation using cubic bezier extrema
- Handles edge cases (single points, degenerate curves, etc.)

### Performance Optimizations

- `WeakCache` for PathBuilder instances
- `LRUCache` for handle generation (100-item cache)
- Memoization keys for avoiding unnecessary recalculation

### Integration with tldraw

- Uses tldraw's `PathBuilder` for rendering (native pattern)
- Proper `StateNode` state machine for tool states
- Implements `FlippableShapeUtil` for proper transform behavior
- SVG export with fill definitions
- Works with all tldraw styles including "draw" style using `perfect-freehand`

## üîç Additional Context

### Design Decisions

**Why we chose `bezier-js` library:**

- Industry-standard bezier curve mathematics
- Handles cubic, quadratic, and linear segments uniformly
- Accurate projection and splitting algorithms
- Same approach tldraw uses for its own geometry

**Why we chose DOM-level event capture:**

- tldraw's handle system intercepts pointer events on anchor points
- Using DOM capture phase lets us intercept events BEFORE handle system
- Enables double-click detection and segment interactions
- Clean separation from tldraw's event system

**Why we chose service-oriented architecture:**

- Makes code testable (pure functions)
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Services are reusable across components
- Follows functional programming best practices

### Known Limitations

- No test coverage yet (recommended but not blocking)
- Some large files could be decomposed further (BezierShapeUtil: 660 lines, Creating: 913 lines)
- Missing JSDoc for some public methods (planned after architectural validation)

### Performance Characteristics

- ‚úÖ Handles paths with 100+ points smoothly
- ‚úÖ LRU cache prevents handle regeneration
- ‚úÖ WeakCache for PathBuilder instances
- ‚úÖ No performance issues observed in testing

## üîÆ Future Enhancement Ideas

These are features we've considered for future development, pending architectural validation and community feedback:

### UX Improvements

**1. Single-handle editing gesture**

- **Current:** Alt+click to drag one control handle independently (breaks symmetry)
- **Proposed:** Double-click-and-drag on a control handle to edit it independently
- **Rationale:** More discoverable, matches industry standards (Illustrator uses Alt+drag, Figma uses Cmd+drag)
- **Question:** What's the preferred tldraw pattern for "modify while dragging" interactions?

**2. Path continuation/closing flow**

- **Current:** Must explicitly close with 'C' key or snap to start point
- **Proposed:** When selecting a bezier shape with an open path, option to:
  - Continue adding points to the end
  - Close the path from the toolbar or context menu
- **Rationale:** Illustrator allows continuing incomplete paths by clicking with pen tool
- **Question:** Does this fit tldraw's interaction model?

**3. Reconsider auto-smoothing on close**

- **Current:** Closing a curve automatically adds smooth control points to the closing segment
- **Observation:** Sometimes users want sharp corners when closing
- **Proposed:** Detect user intent (if last point was a corner, keep closing segment sharp)
- **Question:** What's the best default behavior for closed paths?

**4. Drag-and-drop shape generation**

- **Current:** Bezier tool requires click-by-click path creation
- **Proposed:** Dragging the bezier tool from toolbar creates a random interesting shape (star, blob, etc.)
- **Rationale:** Provides quick starting point, matches other tldraw shape behaviors
- **Question:** Do custom tools typically support drag-from-toolbar creation?

### Feature Additions

**5. Boolean operations**

- **Proposed:** Add context menu options for bezier shapes:
  - Union (combine overlapping paths)
  - Subtract (cut one path from another)
  - Intersect (keep only overlapping areas)
  - Exclude (remove overlapping areas)
- **Technical:** Could use `paper.js` or similar for path boolean operations
- **Question:** Is this something tldraw would want in core, or better as a plugin/extension?
